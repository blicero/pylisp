*** TODO Linters to the rescue [0/3]
    I wrote a Lisp interpreter in Python many years ago (2010, apparently),
    and I am trying to copy some of the code, which makes the linters scream.
    The old code was written for Python 2, so ... no surprise there.
    So here's what I am going to do:
**** TODO Pacify the linters
     Fix everything the linters are barking at
**** TODO Add type hints
     Add type annotations, as far as possible and helpful
**** TODO Testing
     I should probably write some tests, too.
